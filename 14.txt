A curated list of samples
Contained in this list are sample apps, demos, and examples that can help you
grow your Flutter skills. Some are maintained here by the Flutter team,
but many have been created by the Flutter community and are kept in other repos
in and out of GitHub.
This is not an exhaustive list of samples, and just because because a project
isn't listed here doesn't mean that it's not worth exploring. Similarly, while
the Flutter team works to keep this list up to date, there are plenty of others
created by the community, such as
Awesome Flutter from @Solido.
How-to Collections
Flutter Examples  
A collection of single-topic examples from Nishant Srivastava. These include
everything from gradients to JSON to routing and more.
Flutter Example Apps  
Several dozen examples from Flutter GDE Pawan Kumar. These cover state
management, Firebase, UI design, and many other topics. Each one comes with a
YouTube video showing implementation.
Flutter by Example  
Twenty-odd samples detailing common tasks with Flutter: how to use text fields,
streams and StreamBuilders, and more.
Architecture / networking / backend
Flutter Architectural Samples  
Brian Egan's implementations of TodoMVC using a variety of state management and
architectural approaches. If you'd like to see how an app built with
flutter-redux is different from one using BLoC, this is a great place to
start.
jsonexample (Flutter team)
A simple app showing three different approaches to deserializing JSON:
hand-written constructors, json_serializable, and built_value.
scoped_model_counter (Flutter team)
The simplest possible app (the counter) using scoped_model
for state management.
UI
Flutter UI Kit  
Another sample from Flutter GDE Pawan Kumar, this repo includes a variety of
polished UI examples.
Flutter Challenges
More a GitHub search result than a single repo, Matt Carroll's Flutter UI
challenges showcase some amazing designs powered by Flutter. Make sure to check
the accompanying YouTube video so you can watch Matt implement them.
Full apps
It's All Widgets!
Created and maintained by the Flutter community, It's All Widgets collects
links to apps built with Flutter. Many are open source and include links to
their source code, so you can browse through the list until you find something
that looks interesting, and then go see how it was built.
inKino  
An unofficial Finnkino client that shows movies and showtimes of Finnkino
cinemas in Finland. It uses Redux, has a comprehensive set of tests, and shares
40% of its code between the Flutter app and the AngularDart web app.
It's currently available in the
App Store,
Play Store
and as a Progressive Web App.
FlutterFlip  
A simple reversi clone built with Flutter. It showcases some implicit animations
and how to move work off the UI thread into an isolate.
WhatTodo  
A simple todo app that tracks daily tasks, built using the BLoC Pattern. You can
add projects, labels, and due dates to your tasks, and sort them using the same
criteria.
Demos
Shrine (Flutter team)
The Shrine demo app from the Flutter team. It's designed to showcase how apps
can put their own spin on the Material Design components and how to use
ScopedModel to maintain app state across screens.
Flutter Gallery (Flutter team)
The official Flutter Gallery. There's tons of stuff in here. Just tons.
