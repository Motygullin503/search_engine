Made by 

                    Flutter allows you to build beautiful native apps on iOS and Android from a single codebase.
                

Get started


                    Coming from another platform? Docs: iOS,
                    Android,
                    Web,
                    React Native,
                    Xamarin.
                









Fast Development

                Paint your app to life in milliseconds with stateful Hot Reload. Use a rich set of fully-customizable
                widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.
                



Expressive and Flexible UI

                Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full
                customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.
                



Native Performance

                Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and
                fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.
                












Fast development

                    Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly
                    and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix
                    bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times,
                    without losing state, on
                    emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS
                    and Android.
