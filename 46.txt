Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform
that provides hosted backend services such as a realtime database,
cloud storage, authentication, crash reporting, machine learning,
remote configuration, and hosting for your static files.
Firebase supports Flutter. For more information, see:
