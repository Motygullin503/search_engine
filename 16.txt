How GitHub Enterprise works →
Learn how GitHub Enterprise works →







Code security

          Prevent problems before they happen. Protected branches, signed commits, and required status checks protect your work and help you maintain a high standard for your code.
        
Access controlled

          Encourage teams to work together while limiting access to those who need it with granular permissions and authentication through SAML/SSO and LDAP.
        







Hosted where you need it
Securely and reliably host your work on GitHub using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Or deploy GitHub Enterprise Server in your own data centers or in a private cloud using Amazon Web Services, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
