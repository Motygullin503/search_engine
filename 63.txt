Master channel
Installation bundles are not available for master. However, you can get the SDK
directly from GitHub repo by cloning the master channel,
and then triggering a download of the SDK dependencies:
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
$ ./flutter/bin/flutter --version

For additional details on how our installation bundles are structured, see
Installation bundles.
