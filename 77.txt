Bootstrap into Dart

New to the Dart language?
We compiled our favorite resources to
help you quickly learn Dart.
We looked at a lot of languages, and we found Dart easy
and fun to learn.
We hope these resources make Dart easy for you to learn, too.

Language tour
Your best introduction to the Dart language. Learn about Dart’s
features such as optional types, closures, libraries, lexical scoping,
top-level functions, named parameters, async / await, and lots more.
Library tour
A good overview of Dart’s powerful core libraries. Learn about
Dart’s support for collections, async, math, numbers, strings, JSON, and more.
Intro to Dart for Java Developers Codelab
Use your Java knowledge to get up and running quickly with Dart. Learn about
classes, constructors, parameters, and interfaces with examples from the Java
Tutorial.
Effective Dart
Guides for style, authoring documentation, usage, and more.
Asynchronous Programming: Futures Tutorial
Learn how to use Futures, which are used extensively in the Dart core
libraries.  Futures can be used instead of one-time callbacks.
Asynchronous Programming: Streams Tutorial
Learn how to use Streams, which are used extensively in the Dart core
libraries. Streams can be used instead repeating callbacks.
For example, the
File class
uses Streams to read bytes from a file.
