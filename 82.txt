Flutter widget index

This is an alphabetical list of nearly every widget that is bundled with
Flutter. You can also browse widgets by category.








AbsorbPointer
A widget that absorbs pointers during hit testing. When absorbing is true, this widget prevents its subtree from receiving pointer events by terminating hit testing at itself. It still consumes space during layout and paints its child as usual. It just prevents its children from being the target of located events, because it returns true from RenderBox.hitTest.


Documentation









AlertDialog
Alerts are urgent interruptions requiring acknowledgement that inform the user about a situation. The AlertDialog widget implements this component.


Documentation









Align
A widget that aligns its child within itself and optionally sizes itself based on the child's size.


Documentation









AnimatedBuilder
A general-purpose widget for building animations. AnimatedBuilder is useful for more complex widgets that wish to include an animation as part of a larger build function. To use AnimatedBuilder, simply construct the widget and pass it a builder function.


Documentation









AnimatedContainer
A container that gradually changes its values over a period of time.


Documentation









AnimatedCrossFade
A widget that cross-fades between two given children and animates itself between their sizes.


Documentation

Documentation









AnimatedListState
The state for a scrolling container that animates items when they are inserted or removed.


Documentation









AnimatedModalBarrier

Documentation









DragTarget
A widget that receives data when a Draggable widget is dropped. When a draggable is dragged on top of a drag target, the drag target is asked whether it will accept the data the draggable is carrying. If the user does drop the draggable on top of the drag target (and the drag target has indicated that it will accept the draggable's data), then the drag target is asked to accept the draggable's data.


Documentation









Draggable
A widget that can be dragged from to a DragTarget. When a draggable widget recognizes the start of a drag gesture, it displays a feedback widget that tracks the user's finger across the screen. If the user lifts their finger while on top of a DragTarget, that target is given the opportunity to accept the data carried by the draggable.


Documentation

Documentation









DropdownButton
Shows the currently selected item and an arrow that opens a menu for selecting another item.

Documentation









FutureBuilder
Widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a Future.


Documentation









GestureDetector
A widget that detects gestures. Attempts to recognize gestures that correspond to its non-null callbacks. If this widget has a child, it defers to that child for its sizing behavior. If it does not have a child, it grows to fit the parent instead.

Documentation









Hero

IconButton
An icon button is a picture printed on a Material widget that reacts to touches by filling with color (ink).


Documentation









IgnorePointer
A widget that is invisible during hit testing. When ignoring is true, this widget (and its subtree) is invisible to hit testing. It still consumes space during layout and paints its child as usual. It just cannot be the target of located events, because it returns false from RenderBox.hitTest.

Documentation









MediaQuery
Establishes a subtree in which media queries resolve to the given data.


Documentation









MergeSemantics
A widget that merges the semantics of its descendants.


Documentation









Navigator
A widget that manages a set of child widgets with a stack discipline. Many apps have a navigator near the top of their widget hierarchy in order to display their logical history using an Overlay with the most recently visited pages visually on top of the older pages. Using this pattern lets the navigator visually transition from one page to another by moving the widgets around in the overlay. Similarly, the navigator can be used to show a dialog by positioning the dialog widget above the current page.


Documentation









NestedScrollView



Documentation









NotificationListener
A widget that listens for Notifications bubbling up the tree.

Documentation









Scrollbar
A Material Design scrollbar. A scrollbar indicates which portion of a Scrollable widget is actually visible.


Documentation









Semantics
A widget that annotates the widget tree with a description of the meaning of the widgets. Used by accessibility tools, search engines, and other semantic analysis software to determine the meaning of the application.


Documentation









SimpleDialog
Simple dialogs can provide additional details or actions about a list item. For example they can display avatars icons clarifying subtext or orthogonal actions (such as adding an account). 


Documentation









SingleChildScrollView
A box in which a single widget can be scrolled. This widget is useful when you have a single box that will normally be entirely visible, for example a clock face in a time picker, but you need to make sure it can be scrolled if the container gets too small in one axis (the scroll direction).


Documentation









SizeTransition
Animates its own size and clips and aligns the child.


Documentation









SizedBox
A box with a specified size. If given a child, this widget forces its child to have a specific width and/or height (assuming values are permitted by this widget's parent). If either the width or height is null, this widget will size itself to match the child's size in that dimension.


Documentation









SizedOverflowBox
A widget that is a specific size but passes its original constraints through to its child, which will probably overflow.


Documentation









SlideTransition
Animates the position of a widget relative to its normal position.
