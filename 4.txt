Set up an editor





You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with our
command-line tools. However, we recommend using one of our editor plugins for an
even better experience. These plugins provide you with code completion, syntax
highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.
Follow the steps below to add an editor plugin for Android Studio, IntelliJ, or
VS Code. If you want to use a different editor, that’s OK, skip ahead to the
next step: Test drive.


Android Studio / IntelliJ


Visual Studio Code




Install Android Studio
Android Studio offers a complete, integrated IDE experience for Flutter.

Android Studio, version 3.0 or later

Alternatively, you can also use IntelliJ:

IntelliJ IDEA Community, version 2017.1 or later
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, version 2017.1 or later

Install the Flutter and Dart plugins
To install these:

Start Android Studio.
Open plugin preferences (Preferences > Plugins on macOS,
File > Settings > Plugins on Windows & Linux).
Select Browse repositories,  select the Flutter plugin and click
Install.
Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
Click Restart when prompted.



Install VS Code
VS Code is a light-weight editor with Flutter app execution and debug support.

VS Code, latest stable version

Install the Flutter and Dart plugins

Start VS Code.
Invoke View > Command Palette….
Type “install”, and select Extensions: Install Extensions.
Type “flutter” in the extensions search field, select Flutter in the list,
and click Install. This also installs the required Dart plugin.

Validate your setup with the Flutter Doctor

Invoke View > Command Palette….
Type “doctor”, and select the Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor.
Review the output in the OUTPUT pane for any issues.



Next step
Take Flutter for a test drive: create a first project, run it, and experience
“hot reload”.
